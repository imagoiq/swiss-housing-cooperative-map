# üèòÔ∏è Map of swiss housing cooperatives

Did you know that cooperative housing has been a specialty in
Switzerland for over 100 years? [^1] In fact, it‚Äôs even a living
tradition [^2]!

The Swiss housing cooperative association has a [public
map](https://genossenschaften.wbg-schweiz.ch/) based on the data of the
Swiss government and uses Google Maps without providing the data under
Open Data license, sadly. Early 2025, the Tages-Anzeiger newspaper
collected data to provide [an interactive
map](https://www.tagesanzeiger.ch/genossenschaften-wo-die-wohnungen-in-der-schweiz-liegen-185999115531)
as well. Both provide only the building‚Äôs location without further
details. In some canton such maps with details seem to exist [^3], but
using proprietary technologies and still without Open Data license.

This experimental project aimed at mapping and listing the housing
cooperatives in Switzerland with a maximum of details using digital
commons platforms.

This project does not aim at playing an intermediate or building new
tool, but documenting and showing what is possible, what are the
limitations of using OpenStreetMap and Wikidata as well as using the
minimum of tooling and target the minimum of maintenance.

At the moment, the name of this project might be misleading or deceptive
as most of the data is from Western Switzerland, so feel free to add
more data outside it!

## The data

At the moment, data can be checked and viewed on
[umap](https://umap.openstreetmap.fr/fr/map/cooperative-dhabitations-en-suisse_1140470).

## Schema

There is no pre-made or validated model specifically for housing
cooperatives, but most of the proposed tags here are defined in the wiki
of openstreetmap. Those from taginfo or my own imagination are declared
on this page with \[tag de facto\].

To target housing cooperatives, the query takes into account elements
with the key `owner=*` and `operator=*` that are associated with
`building|building:part|building:use=residential|apartments|dormitory|sheltered_housing`.
This avoids associating building-related arts and cultural cooperatives
(such as [Space Alliance
Cooperative](https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/38326020)). The filter
will probably be refined in the future. Note that sometimes the building
is owned by a cooperative, sometimes it‚Äôs not, and a cooperative manages
the building, but the building belongs to a private company. The use of
the two tags `operator` and `owner` makes it possible to identify these
cases.

Neighborhoods founded entirely by a cooperative are also included in the
data using the key `landuse=residential`. It‚Äôs also a good idea to add
tags to each building inside a neighborhood so that they can be counted,
for example.

### Basic tags

- [`owner:type=cooperative`](https://taginfo.openstreetmap.org/tags/owner%3Atype=cooperative)
  \[tag de facto\] or/and
  [`operator:type=cooperative`](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:operator:type)

and either‚Ä¶

for Buildings:

- [`building=`](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Buildings) or
  [`building:part=`](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:building:part)
  or
  [`building:use=`](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:building:use)
  with as value ¬†:
  - [`residential`](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tag:building%3Dresidential)
    or prefer
    [`apartments`](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tag:building%3Dapartments)
    for regular accommodation
  - [`dormitory`](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tag:building%3Ddormitory)
    for student dormitory
  - [`sheltered_housing`](https://taginfo.openstreetmap.org/tags/building=sheltered_housing)
    \[tag de facto\] for accommodation designated for older and/or
    disabled or other vulnerable people

for Neighborhood:

- [`name=`](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:name) - name of the
  neighborhood
- [`landuse=residential`](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tag:landuse%3Dresidential)
- [`residential=apartments`](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tag:residential%3Dapartments)

### Enhance the metadata

#### Owner and/or operator

For the owner of the buildings:

- [`owner=*`](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:owner) - Name
- [`owner:wikidata=*`](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:operator#Further_details) -
  Wikidata ID
- [`owner:short=*`](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:operator#Further_details) -
  Short name
- [`owner:abbr=*`](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:operator#Further_details) -
  Abbreviation of the name

If the building is managed by a cooperative, another type of company or
another cooperative:

- [`operator=*`](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:operator) -
  Name
- [`operator:wikidata=*`](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:operator#Further_details) -
  Wikidata ID
- [`operator:short=*`](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:operator#Further_details) -
  Short name
- [`operator:abbr=*`](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:operator#Further_details) -
  Abbreviation of the name

#### Buildings

- [`architect=`](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:architect) -
  name of the architect who made the building
- [`start_date=`](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:start_date) -
  date which indicate the end of the construction
- [`building:flats=`](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:building:flats) -
  number of flats in total (including cluster)
- [`building:flats:cluster`](https://taginfo.openstreetmap.org/keys/building%3Aflats%3Acluster)
  \[tag de facto\] - number of cluster flats
- [`heating=gas|district_heating`](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:heating)
  r other \[de facto\] values
  [`heat_pump|oil|pellet|woodchip|biogas`](https://taginfo.openstreetmap.org/keys/heating#values) -
  Type of heating system

A bit more experimental:

- [`building:condition=renovated`](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:building:condition) -
  indicate that the building has been renovated
- [`last_renovation=`](https://taginfo.openstreetmap.org/keys/last_renovation)
  \[tag de facto\] - date which indicate the end of the renovation
- [`architect:renovation=`](https://taginfo.openstreetmap.org/keys/architect%3Arenovation)
  \[tag de facto\] - name of the architect who conducted the renovation

See also [the page Buildings on the
wiki](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:building#Additional_attributes)
to get even more tags.

#### Type of rents (experimental)

Housing cooperative are often made to create to add affordable housing
on the market, but not always. To distinguish buildings, there are
currently no standard way in OpenStreetMap. From my research,
[`subsidized=yes`](https://taginfo.openstreetmap.org/keys/subsidized)
\[tag de facto\] have been used 12 times (January 2025) which is not
enough to make any generalization.

I propose some experimental tags to add below which are based on the
concept of affordable housing in Switzerland and particularly in the
Vaud region. I‚Äôve not made enough research to know if this can be
generalised and used in others countries.

In Switzerland, there are two kinds of affordable housing:

- Subsidized housing: the state give money for to build a new unit or
  renovate it. This has then impact to lower the rents. For this use
  case, I‚Äôve used
  [`subsidized=yes`](https://taginfo.openstreetmap.org/keys/subsidized)
  \[tag de facto\].
- Rent control/regulation: the state limits the amount of a rent (with
  various tools). This use case is a bit different as the first one,
  because it can apply on some flats within a building. I don‚Äôt think we
  need to go at the level of counting flats at the moment. I propose to
  use
  [`rent:regulation=`](https://taginfo.openstreetmap.org/keys/rent%3Aregulation)
  with `yes` or `only` to differentiate a building where all the flat
  have it or only some.

One limitation is that the subsidization in some part of Switzerland
seems to be limited to a certain number of years. More knowledge and
experience about it is more than welcome!

#### Miscellaneous

Very often, housing cooperatives have additional facilities:

- A common room. If this is public, it can be mapped via a separate node
  and
  - [`amenity=community_centre`](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tag:amenity%3Dcommunity_centre)
  - [`community_centre=community_hall`](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tag:community_centre%3Dcommunity_hall)
  - [`community_centre:for=cooperative`](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:community_centre:for)
- A shared vegetable garden.
  - [`leisure=garden`](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tag:leisure=garden)
  - [`garden:style=kitchen`](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:garden:style)
  - [`garden:type=community`](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:garden:type)

## Technical Process

### Workflow

Here are the steps to build the GeoJson data:

1.  Query Overpass API
2.  Convert data to GeoJSON with `osmtogeojson`
3.  Add missing addresses with Nominatim API to ways in OpenStreetMap
    that aren‚Äôt tagged with an address (e.g.¬†when address is a separated
    node)
4.  Add more data about owners/operators from Wikidata
